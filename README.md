    Hi, I'm Yiyuan Li. I'm into low-level programming, computer graphics, and anything that makes developers more productive.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
    Rust and Go are my go-to languages. I love building things close to the metal—especially if it involves systems programming or graphics. Got a wild idea or cool project? Hit me up at <a href="mailto:yy@yuan.me">yy@yuan.me</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
    Lately, I’ve gone full Emacs as my main editor—and damn....I crossed over to the dark side... but I still keep my Vim and Tmux close.
